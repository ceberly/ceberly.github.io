      Hi there. I am a software engineer who primarily works on backend systems. This includes API programming, devops and site reliability, data pipelines, database design, frontend dashboard design, and so on.

      I currently live in Vermont, by way of Los Angeles and the Bay Area before that. I'm originally from the Philadelphia area.

      From 2021 to July 2023 I worked as a founding engineer at https://uno.app

      In 2020, <a target="_blank" href="https://staplehealth.io/">Staple Health</a>, a health tech company I helped co-found, was acquired by the New York-based social healthcare company <a target="_blank" href="https://uniteus.com">Unite Us</a> where I worked on the data team.

        My other main thing right now is working with <a target="_blank" href="https://conservationmetrics.com/">Conservation Metrics</a>, a biodiversity monitoring company that uses deep learning to process enormous amounts of audio data.You can read about some of the cool stuff they are doing on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00746-1">Nature's blog</a>.
  More recently, I helped <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/microsoft/acoustic-bird-detection/">develop code</a> for species detection using a very small amount of training data that we released in a partnership with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth-tech-resources#primaryR14">Microsoft's AI For Earth program</a>.
      </div>

      <div>More previously, I worked for Typekit, which was <a target="_blank" href="https://theblog.adobe.com/typekit-is-adobe-fonts/">acquired by Adobe in 2011</a>.
      </div>

      <div>Before that, there was more. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriseberly/">Check LinkedIn</a>.
