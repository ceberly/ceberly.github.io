      Hi there. I am a software engineer who works on building web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
    I primarly work on backend/devops/systems programming. I spend my time in Vermont by way of Los Angeles and the Bay Area before that. I'm originally from outside of Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, I am the CTO and a cofounder at <a target="_blank" href='http://staplehealth.io'>Staple Health</a>. We are a Vermont-based health tech startup.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also do some contracting with <a target="_blank" href='http://conservationmetrics.com/'>Conservation Metrics</a>. 
      You can read about some of the cool stuff they are doing <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00746-1'>on Nature's blog</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Previously, I worked at the digital media company <a target="_blank" href='http://www.superdeluxe.com'>Super Deluxe</a>.</p>
    <p>More previous to that, I worked for <a href='typekit.com'>Typekit</a>, which was acquired by Adobe in 2011.</p>
    <p>
      Other stuff I'm into:
