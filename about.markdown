Hi there. I am a software engineer who works on backend programming. This includes systems programming, devops, data and machine learning pipelines, database design, and so on.

I spend my time in Vermont by way of Los Angeles and the Bay Area before that. I'm originally from outside of Philadelphia.

In 2020, [Staple Health](http://staplehealth.io), a company I helped cofound, was acquired by the New York-based social healthcare company [Unite Us](https://uniteus.com).

My other project right now is working with [Conservation Metrics](https://conservationmetrics.com/), a biodiversity monitoring company that uses deep learning to process enormous amounts of audio data. You can read about some of the cool stuff they are doing on [Nature's blog](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00746-1).

Previously, I worked at the digital media company [Super Deluxe](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/19/18001924/super-deluxe-turner-media-tv-shutdown).

More previous to that, I worked for Typekit, which was [acquired by Adobe in 2011](https://theblog.adobe.com/typekit-is-adobe-fonts/).

Other stuff I'm into:

modular synths and music production, AI and the philosophy of, specifically the hard problem of consciousness, financial markets and quantitative finance.

If you would like to get in touch with me, the best way is through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriseberly/) or you can [download my resume directly](resume.pdf).
